Paideia is a program for libraries to search for books based on different categories, get book recommendations based on the book description of other books and to find and reserve the optimal seat. User data will be stored and a user profile with preferences will be created.

Natural Language Processing was used to categorise more than 800,000 books and to distinct the 8 final categories in 5 subclasses.
Based on that classifications the books are stored in the library.
